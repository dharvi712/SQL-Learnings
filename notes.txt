SQL
What is SQL?
* SQL = Structured Query Language
* Used to talk to a database
* Database stores structured data (rows + columns)
Think like this:
* Database = folder
* Table = Excel sheet
* Row = one record
* Column = one property
- [ ] 
- [ ] A table is rows + columns with data types.
- [ ] SQL IS NOT LIKE C / Java / JS
- [ ] SQL commands are NOT re-runnable safely
- [ ] Some commands are ONE-TIME commands
Command	Can run multiple times?
CREATE DATABASE	❌ NO
CREATE TABLE	❌ NO
SELECT	✅ YES
INSERT	⚠️ Depends
UPDATE	⚠️ Dangerous
